                <p>Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American singer-songwriter and musician,
                    known for his work with the E Street Band. Nicknamed "The Boss", he is widely known for his brand of
                    poetic lyrics, his Jersey Shore roots, his distinctive voice, and his lengthy and energetic stage performances.</p>

                <p>Springsteen's recordings have included both commercially accessible rock albums and more somber folk-oriented
                    works. His most successful studio albums, Born to Run (1975) and Born in the U.S.A. (1984) find pleasures
                    in the struggles of daily American life. He has sold more than 135 million records worldwide and more
                    than 64 million records in the United States, making him one of the world's best-selling artists of all
                    time. He has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy
                    Award, a Tony Award (for Springsteen on Broadway) as well as being inducted into both the Songwriters
                    Hall of Fame and the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1999. In 2009, Springsteen was a Kennedy Center Honors
                    recipient, in 2013 was named MusiCares person of the year, and in 2016 was awarded the Presidential Medal
                    of Freedom.</p>
